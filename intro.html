                            <h2 id="overview"> Overview </h2>
                        </a> I heard Fallout: New Vegas was pretty good. My first playthrough stopped at 50 hours with half of the map unexplored, 3/4ths of the DLCs unfinished and tons of quests still to do. It floored me. It's one of the best RPG video games ever made. New Vegas has a remarkably crafted world full of memorable characters, complex factions and fantastically written, interwoven quests offering dramatically different outcomes. It’s baffling how much content Obsidian Entertainment made in just 18 months. <br>
                        <br> But its infamously creaky game engine and console requirements held its vision back. I knew this when I decided to play it for the first time in 2019. I wanted to give myself the best possible first experience of the game, so I took a few days installing as many mods as I could to fix bugs, optimise performance and revitalise the visuals without touching the gameplay design. During subsequent playthroughs I found mods that restored the strongest cut content and added others enhancing specific gameplay systems without drastically changing the original feel. <br>
                        <br> New merge mods made several others redundant, more content was restored and new gameplay changes emerged. Now my mod list sits at 450ish reworking practically every imaginable aspect of the game in complementary ways. I think the mod list I’ve come up with really makes New Vegas shine as a masterful RPG experience with a busier world, more immersive UI and harder but more fun gameplay. I thought I could thoroughly note my modding journey as a guide for complete beginners to read through. Follow these steps and by the end you'll have a completely revitalised New Vegas experience. <br>
                        <br> I'll likely update this every few months as I have been during the drafting process, but I imagine the changes will be minor. I doubt any new mods will shift the guide’s overall direction. Big shout out to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPo5pDT3bKA&list=PLE7DlYarj-DfopU0CbhfwTYXCx5da5Gd5">Gopher's Getting Started series</a> being the starting point of my modding journey with <a href="https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html">Viva New Vegas</a>, <a href="https://wastelandsurvivalguide.com/">Wasteland Survival Guide</a> and <a href="https://salamand3r.fail/texture-guide"> Salamand3r's Texture Guide</a> being other reference points. This guide site is forked from Viva New Vegan even (the guide began as a thicc GDrive doc). I also checked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamerpoets">GamerPoets</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Mutant_Mods">Mutant Mods</a> for further mod how-tos and suggestions. <br>

                        <li>
                            <b>Stability:</b> The guide includes all essential stability enhancements and no placebo/dangerous mods.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Performance:</b> Every tool, setting, and mod in the guide has been carefully selected and play-tested to ensure maximum possible performance. No 4k texture mods, no ENBs, no poorly scripted weather mods, or any other un-optimized/broken mods.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Better Gameplay:</b> The guide includes many mods that greatly improve the gameplay, without drastically overhauling the core experience or straying away from the game's original intent. This section is highlighted by <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62153" target="_blank">Real Recoil</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66666" target="_blank">Just Assorted Mods</a>. There is also an optional <b>Overhauls</b> section that will make the game much more difficult and add some new vanilla-friendly content. This section is highlighted by <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61592" target="_blank">JSawyer Ultimate Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64623" target="_blank">The Living Desert</a>, so it is not recommended for first time players.

                        <li>
                            <b>Customizability:</b> The guide is partially modular, some mods are optional as indicated by their yellow name. Load order will be provided and it will work even if you left out any mods. For information regarding adding your own mods, see the <a href="#additional_mods">Additional Mods</a> section below.

                            <li> Only the English version of the game is supported for maximum compatibility. The Bethesda.net and Xbox Gamepass versions of the game are also unsupported, as they do not work with xNVSE which is essential for most mods. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> At least 12GB of free drive space. </li>

                        </ul>
                        <li> A text editor (I recommend <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>, but the default Windows notepad will work). </li>
                        <li> An archiving tool (I recommend <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a>. If you use Windows 11 then <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/nanazip/9N8G7TSCL18R?hl=en-us&gl=us" target="_blank">NanaZip</a> is a better option). </li>

                        </a> If you are looking to add more mods to your setup, please wait until <b>after</b> you have completed the guide, or else we will be unable to help you on Discord should you need it. Unfortunately, I do not have the time or energy to provide support for setups that install extra mods on top of the guide. If you do plan on adding mods after you finish the guide, please reference <a href="./avoid-mods.html" target="_blank">this</a> list of mods that you should avoid using. I can not stress enough that it is only recommended to add your own mods if you are an experienced modder and know how to manually make conflict resolution patches and sort your load order! You can't just throw a bunch of mods on top of the guide without doing any conflict resolution or use automated tools and expect your game to function as intended! A reminder that I will <u>not</u> support setups that have added any mods.

                        </a> The guide will make the game run better than vanilla. The game is much more CPU-intensive than GPU-intensive, and it actually handles modern hardware pretty well. Installing the game on an SSD will drastically improve load times and decrease stuttering. Here are the recommended specs for being able to run the guide at 60FPS at 1080p: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>CPU:</b> Any dual-core processor (2.5GHz or more).</li>
                        <li><b>RAM:</b> 8GB of RAM.</li>
                        <li><b>GPU:</b> NVIDIA 600 series card or an AMD 5500 series card.</li>
                    </ul>
