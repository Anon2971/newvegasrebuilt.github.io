                - Reverted back to only the stable version of NVSE due to the unstable version breaking parts of JIP LN <br>
                - Changed links on c6's mods to their new locations <br>
                - Expanded upon enabling extra features from Stewie's Tweaks in the Gameplay module (Gameplay - Mechanics) <br>
                - Decided to lock off the content section until its complete to avoid confusion/people harming their game
            </p>

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Okay, this is about to be a massive wall of text. This update is the biggest one yet for the guide. Inspired by a recent Fallout 4 playthrough I did with a minimal amount of mods, 
                I've decided to remove a lot of the mods that I felt didn't affect gameplay enough to be included. I won't go into too much detail since I've been talking about it for a while on Discord, but even through
                a bunch of mods are being removed, you should barely notice any affect on your actual gameplay if any. And also this update, despite the size, should be fine on an existing save. 
                As always I can't promise that's the case, but you should be fine. Okay, lets get started: <br> <br>
                <strong>From the Core module:</strong> <br>
                Changed NVSE install instructions to download the recently released version <br>
                Re-added OneTweak, in turn changed install instructions for NVGE
                Added sub-sections at the end of most sections containing mods/tools that should be avoided
                Added FNVEdit editing to WMIM to fix a few bugs <br>
                Removed Legion AI/Combat Bark Fix (most important changes are covered by Asterra's Many Fixes, the one's that aren't weren't worth keeping) <br>
                Removed Reinforced Leather Armor Female Mesh Fix (shouldnt need to explain myself on this one) <br>
                Removed Fixed War Room Table (see above) <br>
                Removed Cass Class Fix (tag skills don't affect her gameplay) <br>
                Caleb McCaffery NPC and Hat Bug Fixes (fixes already done by YUP, albeit in a less efficient way) <br>
                Removed Nightkin Scripts Corrected (see above) <br>
                Added FNVEdit editing to Rebreather Tweaked <br>
                Exchanged Vendors Containers Respawn Fix for Simpler Vendor Respawn Fix (my version is a lot simpler as you can tell by the name, requires less conflict resolution) <br>
                Removed SafeAutoSave (ESPless alternative now in Stewie's Tweaks) <br>
                Added Asterra's Many Fixes - Collision Meshes Patch <br>
                Updated Stewie Tweaks INI to reflect new version <br>
                Removed all of the individual c6 (nvse) mods and replaced them with his tweaks package <br>
                Eddie Hears an Explosion will be moved to Content - Improved Vanilla Quests or whatever its called <br>
                Barton Thorn Acts Normally removed (the fact that he will follow you to the ends of the earth was more annoying than immersive) <br>
                Removed Clean Character Creation (some people just dont play on hardcore, also revised character thing might be usefull for like one person) <br>
                Removed First Aid NVSE (giving already OP companions chems is not a good idea) <br>
                Removed Muzzle Flash Control (not noticable) <br>
                Lonesome Road Roughin It Bedroll Kit Fix <br> (original implementation never bothered me, perfect example of me adding a mod because it exists rather than it actually being necessary) <br>
                Removed Day Tripper and Chemist Survivalist Style Fix (mostly fixed by YUP, albeit in a less efficient way. Also some changes are more gameplay oriented than QOL) <br>
                I think I moved Johnson Nash NCR Ammo Fix to Content - Improved Vanilla Quests if I even kept it idk oops <br>
                Removed Bypass Minigames (oh yeah was gonna replace this with something and forgot probably should get on that) <br>
                Exchanged individual Just mods with JustModsMered <br>
                Removed Project FNVIcons and all its related patches (no one ever checks the challenges tab anyways lol, also made for some annoying CR down the line) <br>
                Added Vanilla HUD Remastered to the DarnUI HUD section (guess I forgot to add it to this section?) <br>
                Updated the Conflict Resolution/Load Order.txt/Merge instructions <br> <br>
                <strong>From the Visuals section:</strong> <br>
                Changed order of Poco/NMC/Mgs (based on a poll I did in the Discord) <br>
                Removed Textures Over Time Sandstone/Stone Walls (was fine with Poco's implementation of both) <br>
                Updated ToT Honest Hearts LOD Fix (resizes 4k rock texture now too) <br>
                Added PM's HD Legion Overhaul (heart eyes emoji) <br>
                Removed Wasteland Clothing HD (mostly shitty AI upscaling, not worth performance impact)
                Replaced The Gruntening with Bornagain Combat Armor (preference) <br>
                Removed Shifting Shadows and Metal Armor Metalized (the leather parts of the metal armor looked more like footballs than actual leather used for clothing which made it look out of place) <br>
                Removed NCR Civilian Clothing (more of a recolor rather than actual retexture tbh) <br>
                Removed Hunting Revolver and Ranger Sequoia (not compatible with WMIM) <br>
                Removed Nail Gun Retexture (has anyone ever used this gun before?) <br>
                Added instructions for hiding textures in EXE to prevent the pixelated water bug thing <br>
                Replaced Improved Cyberdogs Textures with Its a Dog's World (preference) <br>
                Removed the following due to un-noticablility: High Resolution Bulletin Board and Primm Flyers, High Res Vanilla Posters and Graffiti, Tweaked Cash Register, Hectrol Tumbleweed High Res Retex, Higher-Resolution Westside Craftsman Window, High Resolution Bobby Pin Box, Retextured Playing Cards, Lucky Shades use Authority Glasses Model, Boone's Machete is a Broad Machete, Improved Rawhide Cowboy Hat Mesh, Adjusted Gambler Hats <br>
                Removed Sheriff Meyers (Sheriff Duster/Hat are unique in vanilla, didnt want to change that) <br>
                Removed Pip-Boys to the People due to CR complications, might return if a few things go my way <br>
                Removed Mr. Gutsy/Handy Animated Eyes (eyes keep blinking after death, very uncanny) <br>
                Removed Mother Lupa and Vicious Violetta (bad dogs) <br>
                Updated Character Expansion Instructions for the new update <br>
                Removed High Resolution Male Body Textures (4k textures, not noticeable even for hand textures since most armors have gloves) <br>
                Removed Distributed Necklaces/Chains (after discussion on the Discord, necklaces werent lore friendly enough, weird that they show up on every NPC) <br>
                Removed Better Posture (not everyone is perfect, okay?) <br>
                Removed Gun Follows Crosshairs in First Person <br>
                Removed the entire Menu Visuals section and implemented Better Pause Menu into Tex/Models <br>
                Updated Conflict Resolution/Load Order.txt/etc for new update <br> <br>
                <strong>From the Gameplay Module:</strong> <br>
                Updated Yukichigai Gameplay Tweaks to remove a lot of the included mods that were too small, plugin was an absolute mess so i built it from the ground up, no more issues and a lot less patches are needed) <br>
                Removed VATS Alternative (JustModsMerged now has bullet time) <br>
                Removed the entire Gameplay - Combat/AI section, integrated BLEED and Melee Cleave into Gameplay - Mechanics (only the AI mods were actually removed, the AI mods were useless and honestly just made combat less fun) <br>
                Removed Cannibal Reborn <br>
                Removed Lonesome Road Flare Ammo (very niche item so it doesnt matter to me) <br>
                Will move Birds of a Feather Bear Arms Together to Content - Vanilla Quests Improved <br>
                Updated all the finish line shit i think you get the drill by now <br> <br>
                Okay that's it! (probably missed some stuff in the changelog, im only human). Come to the discord and yell at me for removing your favorite mod! <br>
                On a serious note, I've been working on this update for a while after going on a hiatus for a bit. This will be the last major update to the guide like this, should only be adding mods here and there as they release/get updated/etc. Thanks for all the continued support, I hope you guys understand the basis of these changes.

                - Removed Fix for the Legion Armors and Survivalist Style Fix from the Core - Merge for the time being (complications with how zMerge handles assigning FormIDs and how that affects conflict resolution. This should only be a temporary solution) <br>
                - Removed Collision Meshes - Ojo Bueno Patch from Visuals - Textures/Models (Poco Bueno has different meshes than Ojo Bueno and would need a different patch)

                - Removed Unnecessary Physics from Core - QOL (like the title of the mod says, its unnecessary and only a fun gimmick for the first minute of two of playing with it)

                - Added instructions for editing ILO in xEdit for compatibility with the above mod in Visuals - Environment/Lighting <br>

                - Added instructions for hiding the .esp from Fallout 4 Styled BoS Uniforms in all Visuals - Textures/Models sections (should've been hidden because of the .esp replacer, I just forgot) <br>
                - Added instructions for hiding the .esp from the main file of Olly's Thematic Loadscreen Pack (.esp is replaced by the optional file, main file needs to be hidden so it doesnt show up after you merge the .esp from the optional file) <br>

                - Removed Improved Quest Objectives from Core - QOL and updated the Core/Gameplay Conflict Resolution FOMODs to reflect that (edits quest scripts/stages, makes for a lot of incompatibility. only included initially because i was going to include a mod that removed a lot of quest markers but it wouldve taken years to do the conflict resolution)
