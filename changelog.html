                - Added instructions for editing ILO in xEdit for compatibility with the above mod in Visuals - Environment/Lighting <br>

        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>6/17/19</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">
                - Re-did the FNVLODGen settings (pretty much just used default terrain LOD settings for the best option and simplicity's sake)
            </p>
        <br> 
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>6/16/19</strong></p>
            <p class="moddesc">

                - Removed Legion AI Fix from the Core - Merge (didnt want to deal with people having the voice assets error, plugin space is completely fine anyways) <br>
                - Added instructions for hiding the .esp from Fallout 4 Styled BoS Uniforms in all Visuals - Textures/Models sections (should've been hidden because of the .esp replacer, I just forgot) <br>
                - Added instructions for hiding the .esp from the main file of Olly's Thematic Loadscreen Pack (.esp is replaced by the optional file, main file needs to be hidden so it doesnt show up after you merge the .esp from the optional file) <br>

                - Removed Vanilla Intro Plus from Core - QOL (don't really know why I put it in the QOL section in the first place, will most likely be back in the content section) <br>
                - Changed the NVGE install instructions to no longer include the main menu music that would play whenever you went from in-game back to the main menu even if the intro is off in the INI
            </p>

                - Removed Improved Quest Objectives from Core - QOL and updated the Core/Gameplay Conflict Resolution FOMODs to reflect that (edits quest scripts/stages, makes for a lot of incompatibility. only included initially because i was going to include a mod that removed a lot of quest markers but it wouldve taken years to do the conflict resolution)

            </p>
        <br>
        <p class="specialinstall"><strong>5/24/19</strong></p>

            <p class="moddesc">
                - Changed instructions for running FNVLODGen (now uses -o: argument due to new information about MO2 not being able to hook files fast enough doing it the other way)

                - Removed Ownerless trash, Lonesome Road True Faction Allegiance, Common Caravan Deck, and Casino Exchange All from Core - QOL (ditching these in favor of a newly edited version of Yukichigai Gameplay Tweaks provided by Sigourn)
