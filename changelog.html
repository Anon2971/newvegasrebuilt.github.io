                        <strong>UI:</strong> Removed JIP Improved Recipe Menu since it's included in the new Stewie Tweaks Essentials INI <br>
                        <strong>Whole Guide:</strong> Made every mod instruction version agnostic <br>
                        <strong>Whole Guide:</strong> Moved patches to repo and updated links <br>
                        <strong>LOD:</strong> Switched to xLODGen <br>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Removed JAM custom INI since it's highly subjective and you can configure it easily <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed custom JIP INI <br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added Climate Control NVSE <br>

                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>HUD:</strong> Switched from Simple DLC Delay to Delay DLC Redux <br>
                        <strong>MO2:</strong> Updated INI settings <br>

                <h2 class="install">2/22/22</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>General:</strong> Updated various mod versions and instructions that were out of date <br>
                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Added kNVSE <br>
                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Removed NVTF INI, default INI settings for newest NVTF are good <br>
                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Removed OneTweak (complicated install and potential performance hit. Alt-Tab should still working fine with newest NVTF but let me know) <br>
                        <strong>HUD:</strong> Added HUD Only Explosion Shake <br>
                        <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Updated WMIM and the WMIM ESP Replacer <br>
                        <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Added New Vegas Mesh Improvement Mod <br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added ISControlEnabler, updated Anniversary Anim Pack instructions accordingly <br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Replaced Altitude with DN Weathers (visual mods are completely subjective so this may make some people upset. Because of this, the alternative weather mods blurb has been expanded to include a few more mods so everyone should find something they like) <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed Laser Weapon Iron Sights (WMIM update now has its own iron sights for all energy weaps) <br> 
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Replaced Unfound Loot with Famine <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed my JSUE tweaks for PTWB's personal tweaks <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added patch for JSUE and WMIM (necessary with its most recent update) <br>
                        <strong>Content:</strong> Added instructions to install the Uncut Extra Collection file from Uncut Wasteland
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">10/30/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Seperated the section into two sections, Bug Fixes and Tweaks <br>
                        <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Added Improved Lighting Shaders <br>
                        <strong>HUD:</strong> Added Consistent Pip-Boy Icons <br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Removed New Vegas Redesigned 2 Revised (after playing every modern Bethesda game and trying a bunch of different face overhauls, I really just think dealing with vanilla faces is the best and by far easiest option) <br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added Anniversary Anim Pack General Bug Fix <br>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Added NPCs Sprint <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed Economy Overhaul (imo the economy will be busted no matter what and you will always have plenty of caps, so making everything cheaper doesn't really work) <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed GRA Relocated (related to above, weapons being on vendors gives the player to spend their plentiful amount of caps on) <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added Misc Gameplay Merge <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed Complex Vendors/Better Ghouls (redundant with Misc Merge) <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added Player Combat Priority <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed Follower Formula Redone (relatively devisive mod, companions are now balanced by Player Combat Priority and charisma is now balanced with the bCapSkillsBySPECIAL setting in Tweaks anyways) <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Removed Mobile Truck Base (didn't really fit the spirit of the guide imo. Also has one unfixable bug lighting bug and one prety crucial bug I couldn't figure out where parts of the van mesh have bad collision and will cause the game to crash if an item collides with them) <br>
                        <strong>Content:</strong> Added a new Content section, which houses Uncut Wasteland and TLD along with a few new mods <br>
                        <strong>Content:</strong> Added Essential DLC Enhancements Merged <br>
                        <strong>Content:</strong> Added Mojave Raiders <br>
                        <strong>Final Steps</strong> Updated load order
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">10/18/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Finally replaced the individual Just mods with Just Assorted Mods, along with a custom INI for it <br>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Removed Marathoner (redundant with Just Assorted Mods' sprint)
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">5/13/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>INI Tweaks:</strong> Set the default value of iNumHWThreads to 2 in case people dont read the instructions to change it, it is safer to have it set to a value lower than the number of threads you have than having it set higher. Nothing has techincally changed provided people follow the instructions correctly though <br>
                        <strong>INI Tweaks:</strong> Removed the [Water] INI changes, as I don't think they help performance at all on high-end PCs and they are also the default settings on the High preset and below so lower-end PCs won't be affected (again provided they read the instructions) <br>
                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Added my own custom INI for NVTF, as the performance INI from the mod page has been removed
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">5/03/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Moved JSawyer Ultimate to the <b>Overhauls</b> section. Since it makes the game more difficult by adjusting the default level cap, carry weight, and health formulas, it seems like a better fit. I still would personally use it even on a first-time playthrough, but I received enough complaints for me to move it
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">4/19/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added a custom INI for Unfound Loot that makes it more cohesive with the rest of the guide out of the box
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">4/6/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>HUD:</strong> Removed Consistent Pip-Boy Icons (there is nothing wrong with this mod at all, but VUI+ now includes a remastered version of the interfaceshared0.dds which was the main reason that CPI was included. You should totally keep the mod if you already have it installed, but for <i>s i m p l i f i c a t i o n</i> purposes, it's being removed. CPI's file size was also about 5x more than the rest of the mods included in the guide lol) <br>
                        <strong>Resources:</strong> Added guide for generating LOD with FNVLODGen <br>
                        <strong>Resources:</strong> Added guide for merging mods with FNVEdit
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">3/29/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Updated WMIM ESP Replacer to include a vanila copy of the <b>1hpequip.kf</b> file. This makes the WMIM Wrist Fix redundant without causing any addition bugs like the wrist fix did (since the bug is now fixed on an engine level with JIP LN NVSE)<br>
                        <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Removed WMIM Wrist Fix (see above) <br>
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">3/16/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Added Console Paste Support <br>
                        <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Added No Muzzle Flash Lights <br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added B42 Weapon Inertia and NV Compatibility Skeleton <br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added Vanilla LOD (custom mod) <br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added A Little More Lamplight <br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added New Vegas Redesigned 2 Revised <br>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Separated the Gameplay section into two sections, Gameplay and Overhauls. Gameplay will contain the smaller mods that don't make the game much harder and just add modern QOL features and stuff. The Overhaul section contains the bulk of the difficulty mods like Unfound Loot and Economy Overhaul) <br>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Added Uncut Wasteland plus NPCs <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added notes to enable bBarterCheckActorBuySellFlags and bLuckDoesntAffectGambling options in Stewie's Tweaks <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added Complex Vendors <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Replaced Fallout 3 Economy with Economy Overhaul (Economy Overhaul got updated recently and is back to being my preferred mod) <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added Better Character Creation <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added Better Ghouls <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added The Living Desert (I find it incredibly hard to play without this mod now, the game is just way too empty without it) <br>
                        <strong>Overhauls:</strong> Added Mobile Truck Base Remastered (am I shilling all my own mods? maybe)
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">3/01/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Exchanged Yellow Goodbye for Altitude (Altitude is my new weather mod that I just released, which I believe or not prefer) <br>
                        <strong>Visuals:</strong> Added Simple Interior Lighting Overhaul <br>
                        <strong>General:</strong> Replaced the home background image with a new screenshot with Altitude. Let me know if you think its kinda hard to read with the white text on the bright lights, its fine for me but I'm sure it varies a lot with monitor settings and all that.
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">2/27/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Added a custom INI for JSUE, which enables the new "Survival Mode" feature and the lowered XP feature among others <br>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Removed Fallout 4 Survival Mode Damage (the Survival Mode option mentioned above in JSUE does the same thing) <br>
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Added Unfound Loot (great mod, surprised it took me this long to add it) <br>
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">2/15/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Gameplay:</strong> Swapped out OG JSawyer for JSawyer Ultimate Edition (call it a failed experiment. I originally thought OGSawyer's simplicity would make it easier to work with, but it really isn't much simpler that JSUE overall. Plus it probably lead to many more questions about why the guide uses OG instead of JSUE lol) <br>
                        <strong>Finish:</strong> Because of the above change, the Conflict Resolution FOMOD isn't needed anymore (well, there is still the YUP - GRA Reloacted patch, but that only patched one small harmless record that will be fixed in the next version of the mod so whatever. no harm in keeping it in your LO if you already have it installed)
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">2/13/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Swapped out UPNVSE for the new UPNVSE Plus (UPNVSE Plus was specifically made to replace UPNVSE) <br>
                        <strong>Finish:</strong> The load order and conflict resolution have both been updated to reflect the above change
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">1/30/21</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>HUD:</strong> Finally re-added Consistent Pip-Boy Icons (I feel like I was waiting for something to re-add it, but I can't remember what it was so whatever. gud mod)
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">1/13/20</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Added New Vegas Heap Replacer to the Utilities section (finally) <br>
                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Changed the installations of the Utilities to manually through MO2 with a note about installing them manually if they don't work when installed through MO2 rather than the other way around (i feel like this was a pretty major source of confusion previously, so hopefully this will clear things up and not totally backfire. Oh and if you already have the utilities installed and working manually, there is no need to change anything) <br>
                        <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Added an ESP replacer for WMIM that strips it down to everything but required texture set/static changes rather than just hiding the ESP (just hiding the ESP caused visual glitches on a few weapons, this will fix that and is still conflict free) <br>
                        <strong>Whole Guide:</strong> Various instruction improvements since i can never be satisfied
                    </p>
                <h2 class="install">12/14/20</h2>
                    <p class="subparagraph">
                        <strong>Utilities:</strong> Changed the NVTF instructions to use a raised iMaxFPSTolerance (300), as the automatic FPS tolerance setting has some issues and will most likely be removed soon
