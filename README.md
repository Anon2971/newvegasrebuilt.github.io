### An Exhaustively Comprehensive Fallout New Vegas Vanilla+ Overhaul Modding Guide

New Vegas Rebuilt is a comprehensive Fallout New Vegas modding guide for beginners and veterans alike. This guide was gradually built over 3 years and 300 hours+ of playtime with reference to many other existing New Vegas mod guides. It's designed to fix bugs, improve performance, restore cut content, polish the original gameplay design, enhance it with difficulty rebalances and additional gameplay features, dramatically overhaul the aesthetics (graphics and sounds) and finally expand NPC and world content with vanilla-friendly mods. The guide is split into element categories with a Vortex Collection per section allowing you to mod your New Vegas install as lightly or heavily as you'd like.

Please note that this site is a Work-In-Progress. I'm transitioning the guide from a Google Drive document to this website, so this guide will appear very similar to Viva New Vegas at first whilst I work on that.
